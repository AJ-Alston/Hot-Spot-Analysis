# Hot-Spot-Analysis
In this project, we performed spatial hot spot analysis using Apache Spark. Tasks included Hot Zone Analysis, determining the "hotness" of rectangles based on point density, and Hot Cell Analysis, calculating the Getis-Ord statistic on NYC Taxi Trip data from 2009-2012 to identify significant spatial hot spots.
